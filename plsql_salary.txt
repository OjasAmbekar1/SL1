/*
Write a PL/SQL code to calculate Gross and net salary of the employee
Employee (Empid, Name, Basic salary, type). Type may be Permanent or temporary.
For Permanent employees following is the calculation for salary
DA - 15% of Basic salary
HRA - 12% of basic salary (if HRA is > 20000 then it will be considered as 20000 only)
Calculate Gross salary by adding DA and HRA
Deductions are 
Income tax -2000 Rs
Net salary= Gross Salary - Deductions
For Temporary Only basic salary and deductions are there 
Prepare a salary table for all
